# HiLo Game
HiLo is a simple game of guessing and calculated risk. The game
starts by shuffling a deck of cards and returns a value between
1-13. You goal is to properly guess if the next card that gets 
shown is higher or lower than the current one. A correct guess
gets you 100 points, whereas an incorrect one takes 75 points 
away. Reach 0 points and you're out!
